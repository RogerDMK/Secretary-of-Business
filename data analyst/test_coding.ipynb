    "I love the large cut flowers of peonies, but they are done in 3 weeks & aren’t fragrant. I’m currently obsessed with dahlia - tons of large blooms to cut for months, the only down side is they aren’t fragrant. Orienta lilies are nice too (large & fragrant), but are also done in 3 weeks. What plant should I discover next?\n",

    "4. Ranunculus: Garden experts recommend Ranunculus as substitutes for flowering Peonies.\n",
    "5. Gardenia: They look similar to Peonies and provide a fragrant addition to your store's selection.\n",
    "Remarkably, Dahlias appear to be a well-liked choice due to their long-lasting blooms and rich individuality.\n",

Let's engage the data team to do this. \\n\\nTo Data_Admin: Could you please pull out sales for each plant variety sold over the last year and rank them? We would like to identify our top three best selling plants.\\n\\nNow, let's move to the next step.\\n\\nMarket team: once we have identified our top-selling plants, we will need you to find plants similar to these options. Your task will be to research online best-sellers in plant shops, check customers' reviews. Also, please pay attention to which kinds of plants home gardeners are talking about online. \\n\\nPlease remember to reference The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map to splice your data with what kind of plants are in high demand in zones where it's legal to ship to (due to interstate plant transport regulations) from Rhode Island.\\n\\nUsing these guidelines the two teams will be able to compile a list of new plants that our client should incorporate into their inventory, based on comparative data from pressing market standards and direct comparisons the client's current top-sellers. \\n\\nWhen this is all completed, we will get back to you with our suggestions. Keep in mind that before finalizing any additions, it will be beneficial for you to consult with your suppliers regarding the viability of stock and delivery for these items.

    "As we can see from the output above, the team collaborated well. The secretary assigned the data team to find our best selling plants and assigned the market team to look for plants similar to these (called after the data team finished) and any popular plants for home gardeners. The secretary gave an insightful summary at the end and ended the conversation with Approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should note some things, the summary at the end used all recommendations based on the 3 best selling plants we had in our database. This is exactly what we were looking for, the summary also suggested checking with suppliers if they have stock which was a good insight. The secretary did however hallucinate a Bruce from the marketing team, we did not at any point name anyone Bruce and suspect that this is based on the articles they found online. With one of the articles being written by Bruce, the LLM did however hallucinate that Bruce is a member of our team. This hallucination did not affect the quality or correctness of the result so it is probably fine.
