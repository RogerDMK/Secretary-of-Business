    "\n",
    "* The Data Team successfully formulated a complex SQL query joining two tables. They then executed it to return the correct information needed to later produce a readable table summary of plants and top sales.\n",
    "* The Marketing team successfully searched the web for relevant Winter 2024 plants. This was aided by first making itself seasonally-aware by checking the current date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The concluding response by the Secretary combines the results from these two teams wonderfully:\n",
    "  * * It suggests increasing the stock for existing plants that sell strongly in the winter like Boxwood, and plants that sell well around Christmas like Poinsettias.\n",
    "  * * The secretary also made an excellent recommendation for adding new indoor plants not in the inventory like Jade plants, citing the long winters in our state.\n"

      "Next, I consulted the Market team about current plant trends and recommendations for the winter season. Based on recent research and articles surrounding winter gardening trends, here are key recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evergreens**: These continue to be popular during winter months as they maintain greenery regardless of snow. Consider stocking Boxwood, as they are already noted for strong sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Poinsettias**: A classic winter plant that traditionally sells well, especially around the holiday season. You currently have 60 in stock, which is a good quantity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Winter Bloomers**: Flowers such as Primrose and Marigolds are also considerable options for decorations and gifts during this period. Both have recently performed well based on sales data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Indoor Plants**: Due to winter's long duration in some states, many consumers look for houseplants that can thrive indoors, such as Jrde or jade plants, which have become trendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Herbs**: Promoting culinary herbs like Rosemary might also see customer interest as friends gather during the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "To bolster sales moving forward, I recommend focusing your marketing efforts on the highlighted plants (Evergreens, Poinsettias, Primrose, Marigolds) while also emphasizing trendy indoor plants. Additional inventory of these categories might increase your sales performance based on their observed marketability.\n",
      "\n",
      "One important step would be to gather customer feedback or conduct a survey that polls what types of plants are most preferred by your current customers for their winter gardening. This will provide further clarity on your future orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to implement these suggestions to enhance your inventory strategy and potentially boost sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approved.\n",

    "Next, I consulted the Market team about current plant trends and recommendations for the winter season. Based on recent research and articles surrounding winter gardening trends, here are key recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evergreens**: These continue to be popular during winter months as they maintain greenery regardless of snow. Consider stocking Boxwood, as they are already noted for strong sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Poinsettias**: A classic winter plant that traditionally sells well, especially around the holiday season. You currently have 60 in stock, which is a good quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Winter Bloomers**: Flowers such as Primrose and Marigolds are also considerable options for decorations and gifts during this period. Both have recently performed well based on sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indoor Plants**: Due to winter's long duration in some states, many consumers look for houseplants that can thrive indoors, such as Jrde or jade plants, which have become trendy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Herbs**: Promoting culinary herbs like Rosemary might also see customer interest as friends gather during the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bolster sales moving forward, I recommend focusing your marketing efforts on the highlighted plants (Evergreens, Poinsettias, Primrose, Marigolds) while also emphasizing trendy indoor plants. Additional inventory of these categories might increase your sales performance based on their observed marketability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important step would be to gather customer feedback or conduct a survey that polls what types of plants are most preferred by your current customers for their winter gardening. This will provide further clarity on your future orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to implement these suggestions to enhance your inventory strategy and potentially boost sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approved.\n",

    "* The Data Team successfully formulated a complex SQL query joining two tables. They then executed it to return the correct information needed to later produce a readable table summary of plants and top sales.\n",
    "* The Marketing team successfully searched the web for relevant Winter 2024 plants. This was aided by first making itself seasonally-aware by checking the current date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The concluding response by the Secretary combines the results from these two teams wonderfully:\n",
    "  * * It suggests increasing the stock for existing plants that sell strongly in the winter like Boxwood, and plants that sell well around Christmas like Poinsettias.\n",
    "  * * The secretary also made an excellent recommendation for adding new indoor plants not in the inventory like Jade plants, citing the long winters in our state.\n"
